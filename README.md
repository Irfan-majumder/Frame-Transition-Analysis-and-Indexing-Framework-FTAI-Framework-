# Frame-Transition-Analysis-and-Indexing-Framework-FTAI-Framework-
FTAI Framework analyzes video transitions, classifying them as abrupt or gradual for precise indexing. It extracts and preprocesses frames, uses CIEDE 2000 for feature extraction, computes similarity scores, and applies GOA for optimization. This ensures efficient video analysis, summarization, and retrieval.
